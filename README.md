  Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)    Exploratory Data Analysis and Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and preparing a   Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)   dataset for predictive modeling. By performing thorough   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)   and preprocessing, the dataset has been transformed into a clean and structured format, ready for building machine learning models.

 

     Project Overview  

Chronic Kidney Disease is a critical health condition requiring early detection for effective treatment. This project aims to:
   Explore the CKD dataset using statistical and visualization techniques.
   Clean and preprocess the data for model readiness.
   Build predictive models to classify CKD and non  CKD cases.

 

     Steps Followed  

 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

  Data Exploration  
   Examined dataset structure to understand features and detect issues.
   Checked for missing values and duplicates.
   Summarized data using statistical methods.

  Data Visualization  
   Visualized distributions and relationships using:
  Histograms  
  Box Plots  
  Correlation Heatmaps  
  Pair Plots  
  Violin Plots  

  Outlier Detection  
   Used the   IQR method   and box plots to identify and handle outliers.

 

 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
   Converted categorical variables into appropriate formats.
   Imputed missing values using   mean  ,   median  , or   mode   strategies.
   Encoded categorical features using   Label Encoding   and   One  Hot Encoding  .
   Split the data into   training and testing sets   for machine learning.

 

 3. Challenges Faced  
     Handling Missing Data  : Choosing optimal strategies for imputation to avoid biases.
     Outliers  : Balancing between removing extreme values and retaining valuable data.
     Encoding Categorical Variables  : Deciding between label and one  hot encoding based on the feature type.
     Data Imbalance  : Addressing imbalances in CKD vs non  CKD classes.

 

 4. Next Steps  
   Building predictive models like   Logistic Regression  ,   Random Forest  , or   SVM  .
   Evaluating model performance using   Accuracy  ,   F1  Score  ,   Precision  , and   ROC  AUC  .
   Addressing class imbalance using techniques like   SMOTE   or   Class Weighting  .
   Deploying the final model using   Streamlit   or   Flask   for real  time predictions.
